<h2><a name="TO_THE_CHILDREN" id="TO_THE_CHILDREN"></a>TO THE CHILDREN</h2>


<p>These little plays&mdash;well-known stories done into dialogue&mdash;were written
for children who like to imagine themselves living with their favorite
characters in forest, in palace, or in fairyland.</p>

<p>It is hoped that you will enjoy these old friends in their new dress
almost as well as you loved them in the old. When you read the words of
bird or tree or prince or child, try to speak with the voice and manner
which you think that character would use. Thus you will make the reading
a joy to yourselves and a great satisfaction to your hearers.</p>

<p>To try to put oneself in the place of another is very good training for
the imagination. It also teaches us to be more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>kind to others and to
all living creatures. We learn that most persons are striving to do
better and to be better, and we grow in understanding and sympathy.</p>

<p>May these little plays help you to the enjoyment of the great dramas
which you will read when you are older.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>At Red Riding-Hood's Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Would you like to go to grandmother's to-day, my child? The
sun is bright and the air is warm and pleasant.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Yes, mother, you know I always like to visit
dear grandmamma.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Then you may go. You may carry your little basket, and I'll
put some honey and a jar of butter in it for grandma.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Oh, that will be a nice present for her! And
may I take her some flowers?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Yes, dear child. Gather some of those you like best.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Here they are, mother&mdash;roses and pansies!
Aren't they pretty?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Very pretty and sweet. Now put on your little red cloak and
take the basket. Be very careful as you pass through the wood, and go
directly to grandma's house.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Yes, dear mother. Nothing will harm me. All
the birds and animals love me and I love them.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Good-by, little daughter. Give me a kiss and take my love to
dear grandmother.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Good-by, mamma: good-by!</p>

<span class="i0">Good morning, merry sunshine,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>How pretty it is here in the wood! Oh, what a lovely bed of moss! You
must come with me, pretty green moss, to grandma's house. Good morning,
pretty bird: will you sing to me this morning?</p>

<p><i>Bird.</i> Yes, little Red Riding-Hood. I will sing to you because you love
all the birds and can understand my song. Soon I'll show you my little
birds who are just big enough to fly.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Thank you, dear bird, I shall be glad to see
the cunning little things. But now I must hurry to grandmother's with
the butter and the honey. Good-by!</p>

<p><i>Bird.</i> Good-by, little friend! Chirp, chirp; chirp, chirp!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Now the little bird has flown away. I must put
this moss in my basket and then hurry along&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Ugh, ugh!</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Oh! how you frightened me, Mister Wolf! Where
did you come from?</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> From my pretty cave, far, far in the dark wood, little girl.
What is your name?</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Why, don't you know me? I'm little Red
Riding-Hood.</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> I'm a stranger in this place, little girl; but I shall know you
the next time I see you&mdash;ugh, ugh! What have you in your pretty basket,
little Red Riding-Hood? It smells like honey.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> It <i>is</i> honey, Mr. Wolf. I am taking it to my
dear grandmother.</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Are you all alone in the wood, my child? Isn't your mother with
you? Aren't you afraid?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/gray011.jpg" width="435" height="520" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Afraid? no, indeed! Why should I be afraid?
All the animals are my friends.</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Oh, yes, of course they are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> your friends! But is it far to
your grandmother's house?</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> No, Mr. Wolf, only about half a mile. You go
down this path to the mill and then turn to the right, and the first
house you come to is my grandmother's. It's a little red house.</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Oh, that is very easy to find! But I know a shorter way through
the wood. Let us run a race and see who will get there first.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> All right, Mr. Wolf. Good-by!</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Ugh, ugh; good-by!</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> How fast he runs! I know he will win the race.
How surprised dear grandma will be when Mr. Wolf knocks at the door! Now
I see the mill. I will sing the pretty mill song we learned in school
the other day.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Begins to sing, then stops suddenly.</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, there is the miller. Good morning, Mr. Miller! Have you seen Mr.
Wolf go by?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><i>Miller.</i> No, little Red Riding-Hood. Have you seen a wolf in the wood?</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Yes, Mr. Miller, and he said he would race
with me to my grandmother's house.</p>

<p><i>Miller.</i> My dear child, I will call the men who are chopping trees in
the forest and they will catch Mr. Wolf. He is no friend of ours, and
you must not talk with him, for he is cruel and will do you harm.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Will he? Then I will never say another word to
him. But I must hurry on to dear grandmother's.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>Grandmother's House</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Here I am at the door; I will knock. May I
come in, dear grandmother?</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i> (<i>in the house</i>). Open the latch and walk in.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Here I am, dear grandmother! I am so glad the
bad wolf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> did not get here first. Are you so sick you must stay in bed?
See the nice butter and honey that mother sent you. And see the pretty
flowers I've brought you.</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Thank you, my child.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> How rough your voice is, grandmother!</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> That's because I've such a bad cold.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> But how bright your eyes are, grandmother!</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> The better to see you, my child.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> How long your arms are, grandmother!</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> The better to hold you, my child.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> And how big your teeth are, grandmother!</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> The better to eat you&mdash;ugh! ugh!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The miller and the wood choppers rush in.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. Miller.</i> Here's an end to you, Mr. Wolf! These men with their axes
will stop your cruel deeds.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The wolf runs out, followed by the men.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>Come, little Red Riding-Hood, don't be afraid. The wolf can't harm you
now. Here is your grandmother, who has just come home from the village.
She will take care of you.</p>

<p><i>Little Red Riding-Hood.</i> Dear grandmother! I thought that the wolf was
you.</p>

<p><i>Grandmother.</i> Darling little Red Riding-Hood! How glad I am that you
are safe. Now you must stay with me till your mother comes, and we will
tell her how the brave men saved you and me from the hungry wolf. Won't
she be glad to see her little Red Riding-Hood again?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>Goldilocks in the Garden with her Doll</i></h3>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> O dear! I do wish mother would come home. I am going to
meet her. She told me not to go out of the garden lest I should get
lost; but if I keep in the road, I <i>can't</i> get lost! Come, Dollie, you
and I will go just a little way to meet mamma.</p>

<p>How warm it is in the sunshine! I think we shall go into the shady wood
a little while. Let us pick some of these pretty flowers to make a
wreath&mdash;won't mother be surprised when I show her all these flowers.
Here is a lovely red one; and here's another like a daisy.</p>

<p>How dark it is here! I cannot see the road. I wonder if I'm lost! O
mamma,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> mamma! I'm afraid. Dear Dollie, I'm glad you are with me.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> But I'm afraid, too!</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Please, dear Dollie, don't be afraid. Why, there's nothing
to be afraid of&mdash;oh!</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> What is the matter, Goldilocks?</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Look, what is that?</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> I don't see anything.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> I thought I saw a bear.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Well, I hope not. I don't like bears.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> But there is a little house. Isn't it a funny little
house? I wonder who lives there!</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Dear Goldilocks, please, don't you think we'd better go home?
I don't like strange little houses in the wood.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Perhaps a kind fairy lives there who will show us the way
home.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Yes, or perhaps she is the Gingerbread Witch who will turn us
into gingerbread for her supper!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><i>Goldilocks.</i> Don't say such uncomfortable things, Dollie. She couldn't
turn you into gingerbread, anyway.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Well, I know I'm made of sawdust, but she might make mush of
me for breakfast!</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> I know you're fooling now, dear Dollie. Let's look in the
window. I don't see anyone. I'll knock at the door. No one answers.
Come, Dollie, we'll open the door and walk in. How nice and warm it is.
There is a good fire in the kitchen stove.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Yes, and I smell something good to eat.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Here it is on the table&mdash;what pretty bowls&mdash;one, two,
three! I'll taste the porridge in the big bowl first. O Dollie, it is
too hot! I burned my mouth.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Try the next bowl. Perhaps the porridge in the middle-sized
bowl is not so hot.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> No, indeed, it isn't; but it is too cold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><i>Dollie.</i> Aren't you hard to please? I'm so hungry I could eat anything.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/gray019.jpg" width="575" height="521" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Now this in the little bowl is just right. Sit down,
Dollie, and we'll eat it all up.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Do you think it is very polite for us to eat it all?</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> You should have spoken of that before. It is too late now
when it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> all gone. Come, let us go into the parlor.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Don't you think we'd better go home?</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> How can we when I don't know the way? I'm tired, and I
think I'll rest awhile in this nice big rocking-chair. But it's too
high; I can't get into it.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Don't move it out of its place.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Never mind! I'll try the middle-sized chair. I don't like
this, it is too low.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Well, Goldilocks, you must not put chairs out of their places!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 329px;">

</div>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Oh, it won't hurt them. Now let us try this pretty little
chair. Come, Dollie, I'll sing you a song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Rock-a-bye, Dollie, in the treetop,<br /></span>

<span class="i20">When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="center">[<i>Chair breaks.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Well, something broke then!</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> Yes, the cradle and all came down that time. Dear, O dear!
I wish I hadn't rocked you so hard. I wish I hadn't run away!
[<i>Crying.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Don't cry, dear Goldilocks. Let us see what we can find in the
next room. Perhaps some one is in there who will take us to your dear
mother.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> O Dollie! I'm a naughty girl not to mind my mother. If I'd
only stayed at home in the garden!</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> Oh, see the big bed!</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> I'm so tired I believe I'll climb in and go to sleep. But
I don't like it. This big bed is too hard.</p>

<p><i>Dollie.</i> And this middle-sized one is too soft.</p>

<p><i>Goldilocks.</i> But this little one is <i>just right</i>.
Go&mdash;to&mdash;sleep&mdash;Dollie&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Father Bear.</i> Well, little son, aren't you about ready to go home?</p>

<p><i>Sonny Bear.</i> Oh, no, father! Let me play just a little longer. Here are
such good places to hide in the shady wood.</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> No, dear little sonny, we must go home now. It is getting
late. It's time for you to have your supper and go to bed.</p>

<p><i>Sonny Bear.</i> All right, mother dear. I believe I am hungry, and your
porridge is always so good.</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> Most children like porridge. Perhaps you can have a nice
red apple, too.</p>

<p><i>Sonny Bear.</i> Oh, goody! Little sonny bears always like apples, don't
they, papa?</p>

<p><i>Father Bear.</i> Yes, my dear. Mother, let me take your knitting basket.
What are you making now?</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> A warm cap for sonny. Isn't it pretty?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><i>Father Bear.</i> Very pretty, and he should be very glad he has such a
good mother.</p>

<p><i>Sonny Bear.</i> She <i>is</i> a good mother, and you are a very good father,
too.</p>

<p><i>Father Bear.</i> Well, here we are at home again. But the door is open.
I'm certain I closed it when we went away. Who has been here?</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> Let us take off our wraps and have our tea.</p>

<p><i>Father Bear.</i> Why, somebody has been tasting my porridge.</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> What? Let me see! Some one has left a spoon in my
porridge, too.</p>

<p><i>Sonny Bear.</i> Oh, mamma! Look at my bowl! Some one has eaten my porridge
all up.</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> Never mind, sonny boy, you may have some of mine. But I
wonder who has been here. Let us go into the parlor and see if anyone is
there.</p>

<p><i>Father Bear</i>. Who's been moving my chair?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><i>Mother Bear.</i> Some one has been sitting in my chair!</p>

<p><i>Sonny Bear.</i> Look, mother! Some one has been rocking in my chair and
broken it all to pieces! O dear! my nice little chair!</p>

<p><i>Father Bear.</i> Never mind, Sonny Bear; don't cry. I'll buy you another
chair at Mr. Wolf's store to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Mother Bear.</i> And now it is time for us to go to bed. Our little son is
tired and sleepy.</p>

<p><i>Father Bear.</i> I'll carry him up stairs. Come, sonny, there you are up
on my shoulder.</p>

<p class="fm3">PERSONS IN THE PLAY&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Bird</span>, <span class="smcap">The Oak Tree</span>, <span class="smcap">The Maple</span>, <span class="smcap">The Willow</span>, <span class="smcap">The
Spruce</span>, <span class="smcap">The Pine</span>, <span class="smcap">The Juniper</span>, <span class="smcap">The Forest Fairy</span>, <span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Woods</i></h3>

<p><i>The Oak.</i> See that flock of birds coming! The winter is near and they
are flying south.</p>

<p><i>The Maple.</i> I hope they will not light on my branches; I like to keep
my leaves in order.</p>

<p><i>The Willow.</i> So many birds will break my tender twigs. I am sure I do
not want them either. Here they come!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The birds fly over the trees.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> Oh, I can fly no farther! My wing is broken and I cannot
hold it up. I am so tired and cold and hungry! I must rest to-night in
this forest. I am sure some big strong tree will give me a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> resting
place. I will ask this tall Oak, he looks so strong and his leaves are
so thick and warm! May I rest in your branches to-night, great Oak Tree?
I am a poor little bird with a broken wing and I am cold and tired and
hungry.</p>

<p><i>The Oak.</i> I am sorry; but my branches are all engaged by the squirrels,
who are getting their acorns in for the winter. I have no room for
strange birds.</p>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> Oh! I am so lonely, so tired! Surely the handsome Maple
Tree will take me in. She has no acorns and so the squirrels will not be
in her branches. Kind, lovely Maple Tree, may I rest to-night in your
branches? I am a poor little bird with a broken wing. I will not harm
your pretty leaves.</p>

<p><i>The Maple.</i> My leaves tremble to think of taking in strange birds! My
house is in perfect order and I cannot think of disturbing it. Please go
away!</p>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> Oh, what shall I do? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> Oak and the Maple are so unkind
and I am shivering with cold and weak with hunger. Surely <i>some</i> tree
must be kind. Dear Willow, you are kind, are you not? Will you take me
upon your graceful branches just for to-night?</p>

<p><i>The Willow.</i> Really, Mr. Bird with the broken wing, I think you should
have gone on with the other birds. I cannot take you in. I do not know
your name or anything about you. Besides, I am very sleepy, and so, good
night!</p>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> Oh, my dear bird friends, how I wish some of you were
here! I shall perish with the cold if I must stay on the ground. Where
can I go? The Oak, the Maple, and the Willow have all turned me away and
the night is coming on.</p>

<p><i>The Spruce.</i> Dear little bird with the broken wing, come to me! Can you
hop up into my branches if I hold them down to you? See, here I am! I am
not so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> handsome as the Maple tree, but my leaves grow thick and I'll
try to keep you warm through the night. Come!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gray029.jpg" width="500" height="282" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> Dear Spruce tree, how kind you are! I did not see you at
first. Yes, here I am, on your lowest branch. How cosy and warm I feel.
Oh, you are so good, and I was so tired and cold. Here I'll rest. I wish
I could ever thank you enough for your goodness.</p>

<p><i>The Spruce.</i> Do not speak of that, dear little bird; I am ashamed of
the proud, selfish trees that would not shelter you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> Should we not all
be kind and helpful to one another?</p>

<p><i>The Pine.</i> Well said, sister Spruce. And I will do my best to help you.
I am not so strong as the Oak tree, little bird, but I will stand
between you and the cold north wind. Rest warm and safe in the branches
of the kind Spruce tree.</p>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> I thank you, tall Pine tree, for your kindness. You are a
good brother of the Spruce and I shall rest well while you are both
taking care of me.</p>

<p><i>The Juniper.</i> I cannot keep the strong north wind from you, little bird
with the broken wing, but if you are hungry, you may eat of my berries.
Perhaps then you will rest better.</p>

<p><i>Little Bird.</i> Thank you, dear Juniper tree. Why are you all so kind to
me? Your berries are good, and now I am cold and hungry no longer. I'll
go to sleep. Good night, dear trees!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><i>Trees.</i> Good night, little bird, and may you have sweet dreams!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Midnight in the Forest</i></h3>

<p><i>Jack Frost.</i> Here I am in the great forest. How I dislike to touch all
these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> beautiful leaves; yet I must obey the orders of King Winter. Here
comes the Forest Fairy. Do you know why I have come, dear Fairy of the
Forest?</p>

<p><i>Forest Fairy.</i> Yes, Mr. Frost. I know that you must touch all the
leaves, turning them into brilliant hues of gold and crimson and brown.
I dislike to have them go, and yet you and I must obey the commands of
King Winter. But,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jack Frost.</i> But what, dear Fairy? You speak as if you had some wish to
make&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p><i>Forest Fairy.</i> I must tell you. Such a dear little bird came to the
forest this evening. He had a broken wing, and he was cold and very
tired. He asked shelter from the great Oak, the proud Maple, and the
graceful Willow,&mdash;and all refused. I was so ashamed of my trees!</p>

<p><i>Jack Frost.</i> What! did all the trees refuse to help a poor, tired
little bird?</p>

<p><i>Forest Fairy.</i> Listen! just as I was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>tending to speak to the trees,
I heard the Spruce tell him to come to her branches and she would give
him shelter. Then the Pine tree offered to keep the north wind from him,
and the Juniper gave him her berries to eat. Could you, dear Jack
Frost&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jack Frost.</i> Yes, yes, I know what you would ask. Such kindness as this
should meet with some reward. The leaves of the proud Oak, the Maple,
and the Willow shall fall to the ground when the cold of winter comes;
but the Spruce, the Pine, the Juniper, and all their family shall keep
their leaves and they shall be green all through the year. They shall be
called the Evergreen Trees.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Welcome, thrice welcome, fair Julia.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Nydia carries Julia's casket.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Thanks, dear Cornelia, for your kind greeting. May you and all

me, what treasures have you in that charming casket?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><i>Julia.</i> A few poor jewels, fair friend. Bring me the casket, Nydia.

<p><i>Julia.</i> See, here is a pearl necklace.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> How lovely! Let me clasp it about your neck. It is very
becoming. And what other gems have you?</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Here is a girdle my mother gave me for a wedding present. Isn't
it pretty?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Pretty! my dear, it is exquisite! Your mother showed much
good taste when she chose this for you.</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> And here are some rings from the far East. See these emeralds
and rubies; how they flash in the sunlight!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> How well they look on your white hands! But I see something
else.</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Yes, this is my handsomest jewel, a diamond bracelet. This I
like best of all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><i>Cornelia.</i> They are all lovely, my dear friend, and I am glad you have

<p><i>Mother.</i> I am so glad we are all invited to the ball at the Prince's

<p><i>Father.</i> Yes; and I suppose you will all have to buy new ball dresses.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> O mamma! isn't it lovely! May I have a blue silk dress?</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> And may I have pink, dear mother? And shall we get them

for a child like you. You are better off at home by the kitchen fire.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> But I'm fourteen. Sister Katherine, won't you coax mamma
to let me go?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> No, indeed, I'll not! What would you do at a ball? a silly

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Don't be a goose. Wait till you're older and better
looking. There's no room in the carriage for you, and you are too young,
anyway.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Come, girls, it is time for us to go down town to buy our new
gowns. Cinderella, go to your lessons. Don't think any more about the

Why, it is much finer than papa's black carriage.</p>

into great handsome horses with long manes and tails! You dear horses!
I'll get you some sugar to eat.</p>

<p><i>Fairy Godmother.</i> Don't stop to pet them now, but fetch me the
mousetrap.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Here it is with two cunning little mice in it. What will
you do with them?</p>

<p><i>Fairy Godmother.</i> Touch them with my fairy wand and turn them into a
coachman and a footman. See, the coachman is on the box with the reins
in his hand, and the footman holds the door open for you. Will you step
in, Cinderella?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><i>Cinderella.</i> In <i>these</i> clothes, dear godmother?</p>

<p><i>Fairy Godmother</i> (<i>laughing</i>). That wouldn't be nice, would it? Well,

me what you see there.</p>

What a beautiful dress! And look, dear godmother! see my pretty glass

<p><i>Fairy Godmother.</i> Yes, my dear, you are all ready for the Prince's
ball. I want you to have a happy time, but remember this. You must start
for home when the clock strikes twelve or your pretty clothes will
change, your coach will turn into a pumpkin, your horses to rats, and
you will have to walk home.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> You say well, fair lady, for no one can look upon you without
thoughts of love and joy.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> And you, great Prince, have thoughts of great and noble
deeds, have you not?</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Yes, I have thoughts of great deeds, of brave men and fair

enough.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> I hear the clock! What hour is it striking?</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Twelve&mdash;but that is early. You need not go?</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Yes, I must, and quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> Do not try to keep me,

her? I'll give another ball and hope she will come again.</p>

princess that came so late?</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> She was the prettiest girl there. I wonder who she is!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> So do I. It seems to me I've seen her somewhere. Perhaps I've
met her in my travels; but I can't remember where it was.</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> What is her name?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> I heard some one say she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> was Lady Far Away. But that's not
a real name.</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Perhaps she is a princess in disguise.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Tell me, sister, how this princess looked.</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Oh! she is lovely! Golden curls and blue eyes and such a
sweet smile!</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> She wore a beautiful dress that shone like the moonlight.</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Did you notice her pretty slippers? They looked like
crystal.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> The Prince danced with her all the time.</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> Why, here comes the Prince's herald. I'll see what he wants.
Here is a note. It is an invitation to go to the Prince's palace again
to-night. Do you all want to go?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Yes, yes, father, please!</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> All right, we'll go!</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Can't I go this time, mamma?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><i>Mother.</i> No, my dear. When you are a little older you can go, but not
now.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene V.</span>&mdash;<i>At the Palace</i></h3>

<p><i>Prince.</i> I wonder if my fairy princess will come to-night. I've been
looking for her for more than an hour. Oh, here she is! Dear lady, I've
been hoping you would come.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> So you have not forgotten me?</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> No, and never shall. Will you go with me to see the flowers?</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> What lovely flowers! This is certainly the home of the
flower fairies. See the roses nodding at us. They almost ask us to love
them.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> May I give you this dainty pink one? It is the color of your
cheeks.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Remember I am from the land of Far Away and I must vanish
at midnight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><i>Prince.</i> Tell me where your father lives that I may call upon him.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Not now; but sometime I may tell you about my fairy
godmother.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> There! I knew you must be a sister of the fairies. Does your
fairy godmother have a fairy wand?</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Yes, and she does wonderful things with it&mdash;but my father
and mother do not know about her.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Of course not. Only very young people know about fairy
godmothers. But we know, don't we?</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Hark! I hear the chimes ringing. It must be twelve
o'clock, and I must go.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Do not go, dear princess. Stay here in my palace, always.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> The fairies are calling me and I am late. I must go.
Perhaps I can come again sometime. Oh, I am afraid&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Afraid of what?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><i>Cinderella.</i> Good-by, good-by!</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> She's gone! What was she afraid of? I cannot see her! Who is
that child running down the stairway? She must be one of the servants
who has been watching the dancers. I wish I could see my princess. What
is that shining thing on the stairs? She has lost one of her crystal
slippers. Now I know how I shall find her. To-morrow I shall send a
herald through the city to find the owner of this pretty little slipper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Cinderella's Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Mamma, mamma, here is a man on horseback who wants to see
you.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> What is your errand, sir?</p>

<p><i>Herald.</i> I am sent by the great Prince of our country to find the owner
of this slipper. He says he will marry no one but the lady who can wear
this little crystal slipper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><i>Mother.</i> I'll call my daughters. Katherine! Elizabeth! We were all at
the ball at the Prince's palace. Katherine, is this your glass slipper?
Try it on.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> Yes, mother. My, how small it is! I cannot get my foot in
it!</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Perhaps it will fit me. My feet are smaller than yours. No,
I cannot push my foot in, no matter how long I try. It must be a magic
slipper.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> May I try on the slipper?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> My dear child, why should you try on the slipper? It belongs
to the princess who went to the ball.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> And you were not at the ball, Cinderella!</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Your foot is too big for it, my dear little sister.</p>

<p><i>Herald.</i> Pardon me, ladies, but the orders of the Prince are that every
lady, young or old, must try on the slipper, and when the owner is found
she must go with me to the palace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><i>Cinderella.</i> Give it to me, please. See how easily it slips on my
foot&mdash;and here is the mate to the glass slipper in my pocket. Dear
Mother, I am the fairy princess you saw at the ball.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> You, my dear! and I did not know you!</p>

<p><i>Herald.</i> Now, lady, please come with me to the Prince's palace. You
shall be a princess.</p>

<p><i>Cinderella.</i> Good-by, dear sisters! Good-by, dear mother! I am going to
the Prince's palace.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>The Mayor's Office</i></h3>

<p><i>Mayor and Councilmen, sitting around a table.&mdash;Citizens come in.</i></p>

<p><i>First Citizen.</i> Our Mayor is a noddy!</p>

<p><i>Second Citizen.</i> Look at our corporation sitting in the gowns we pay
for, and doing nothing!</p>

<p><i>Third Citizen.</i> See here, how the rats made a nest in my Sunday hat!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">

<p><i>Fourth Citizen.</i> When I was cooking dinner the bold rats licked the
soup from my ladle!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><i>Fifth Citizen.</i> They are so bold they are always fighting with the dogs
and cats!</p>

<p><i>Sixth Citizen.</i> Yes, and they kill them, too!</p>

<p><i>Seventh Citizen.</i> My baby cried in his sleep, and when I went to him
there was a big rat in his cradle.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Citizen.</i> What are you going to do about it, Mr. Mayor?</p>

<p><i>Ninth Citizen.</i> You'd better wake up, sirs! Don't go to sleep over
this!</p>

<p><i>Tenth Citizen.</i> I tell you, you'll have to do something to save us from
this army of rats!</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> What <i>can</i> we do?</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> I'm sure we've tried everything, but every day the
rats grow worse and worse.</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> I'm sure it isn't very pleasant for us to have the
city overrun with the creatures!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> I'd sell my ermine gown for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> guilder! It is no easy thing to
be mayor and I wish I was a plowboy in the country! Try to think of
something to do.</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> It is easy to bid us rack our own brains!</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> I'm sure my head aches trying to think.</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> I've wondered and thought, till I've no thoughts
left.</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Oh! if I only had a great big trap! Yes, a thousand big traps!
Bless us, what noise is that? Is it a rat?&mdash;Come in!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter Piper.</i>]</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> Who is this who dares to come into the Mayor's
office without an introduction?</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> Hasn't he a funny coat?</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> But what a pleasant face! He smiles all the time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><i>Mayor.</i> He looks like the picture of my grandsire. What is your name,
and your business, my man?</p>

<p><i>Pied Piper.</i> Please your honors, my name is Pied Piper. My business is
to play upon my pipe. I can charm with the magic of my notes all things
to do my will. But I use my charm on creatures that do people harm, the
toad, the mole, and the viper, and rats&mdash;rats!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Rats! Well, then, you're the man we want. We'll pay you a
thousand guilders if you'll free our town of rats.</p>

<p><i>Piper.</i> A thousand guilders! Done! It's a bargain!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Same as Scene I. The Mayor and Councilmen looking out of
window</i></h3>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> There he goes down the street.</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> What a strange looking pipe he plays!</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> I believe it must be a magic one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><i>Third Councilman.</i> Do you hear the music? What is that other noise?</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Look, look at the rats! Did you ever see such a sight!</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> The streets are crowded with them! Big and little,
brown, black, and gray, they are tumbling over each other in their
hurry!</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> Sir! he is going toward the bridge.</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> They must think he is playing a tune of apples and
cheese!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> There they are at the river. They are plunging in! they will be
drowned!</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> Good for the piper!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Ring the bells for the people. Tell them to get long poles,
poke out the nests and block up the holes!</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> Here comes the Piper.</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> That was well done, Mr. Piper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><i>Pied Piper.</i> Yes, all the rats are drowned and now I've come for my
pay.</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Pay! why what have you done? Just played a tune on your pipe.
You must be joking.</p>

<p><i>Piper.</i> You promised&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> You impudent fellow! You certainly don't think a
tune on your pipe is worth one thousand guilders? There is no work in
that.</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> The rats are dead and can't come to life again, I
think!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> My friend, we are much obliged, of course. We are much obliged
and will gladly give you fifty guilders. You know your time is not worth
more.</p>

<p><i>Piper.</i> No trifling, pray. I'll have what you promised, or you may find
that I'll play a tune you do not like!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> What! do you threaten us, fellow? Do what you please. Do you
think we care? Play on your old pipe whatever tune you wish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><i>Piper.</i> Listen, then, and look from your window when I play again in
the street below.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p><i>Mayor.</i> What does the lazy fellow mean by his threats?</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> Hear his wonderful music! Listen.</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> Oh! what is he doing! See the children!</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> They are following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> him. There is my son. Where are
you going, my boy? Come back!</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Let me see! O woe! there are my own three lovely children. Run,
some one, and stop them!</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman.</i> I'll go; I'll go.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Runs out.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> It is useless. Every child in our city is following the magic
sound.</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> The music seems to say: "Come, children, to the
wonderful land of play. There flowers and fruits will welcome you. The
birds and beasts will play with you, and you will never be sad or sorry
in the wonderful land of play." No wonder the children follow the Piper.</p>

<p><i>Third Councilman</i> (<i>enters</i>). The children and the Piper have all
disappeared! A mountain opened and let them in!</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> The children, the blessed children, have gone! What
shall we do without the children?</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Oh, wicked man that I am!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> Why did I break my promise? Why did
I not give him the thousand guilders?</p>

<p><i>Second Councilman.</i> Yes, we are all wicked men, and we are punished for
not keeping our word.</p>

<p><i>Mayor.</i> Let us write this sad story on a column so that all may read;
and let us paint the picture of the Piper with our little ones following
him, on a church window, so that all men may know how our children have
been stolen away.</p>

<p><i>First Councilman.</i> And may this sad story teach us all to keep our word
with every one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>Home of Mother Goose</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> I really think I must give a party. All my friends have
been so good to me and I have been entertained in so many homes!
Wherever I go I am sure to see one of my Mother Goose books, and the
children all seem to love it so much. Let me see! whom shall I invite? I
think I'll ask Old Mother Hubbard to take tea with me and we'll talk
about the party together. Jack, Jack!</p>

<p><i>Jack</i> (<i>enters</i>). Yes, mother dear, what is it?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Jack Goose, I wish you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> to run over to Mother Hubbard's
house and ask her to take tea with me this afternoon. Now be nimble,
Jack,&mdash;be quick!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Yes, mother dear. See me jump over the candlestick! Isn't that
fine jumping?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Very fine indeed, Jack. Now do your errand, and hurry
home.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Yes, mother, I will. Good-by.</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Good-by.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>House of Mother Hubbard</i></h3>

<p><i>Jack</i> (<i>knocking</i>). I wonder if Old Mother Hubbard is at home. Hark! I
hear her dog barking. Yes, and I hear her step. Here she is!</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard</i> (<i>opening the door</i>). Who is this knocking so loud? Oh,
it's you, little nimble Jack! Will you come in?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> No, thank you, Mrs. Hubbard. My mother wishes you to come over
to our house for tea this afternoon. Will you come?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> Yes, thank you, Jack, I will. Tell your mother that
I'm just going to market to buy my poor doggie a bone.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> O Mother Hubbard! <i>please</i> let me play with your dog. He's such
a dear old doggie! Do you remember how he danced a jig the other day?</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> Yes, Jack, I do; and I think you danced with him. You
are both nimble young things and both like to dance. Well, good-by, now.
Have a good time together and I'll bring you something little boys like.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Thank you! Good-by, good-by! Now, doggie, let's dance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cupboard,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To get the poor doggie a bone;<br /></span>

<p><i>Dog</i> (<i>sadly</i>). Bow-wow, bow-wow, bow-wow!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Oh! you don't like that song! Never mind, old fellow! Mother
Hubbard has gone to the butcher's and she'll get you a bone, I'm sure.
Wait till she comes back.</p>

<p><i>Dog</i> (<i>gayly</i>). Bow-wow, bow-wow, bow-wow!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> I thought you would like that. Here she comes now. We've had a
lovely dance, Mother Hubbard, and now I must hurry home.</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> Thank you for staying and taking good care of my dog.
Here are some fresh Banbury buns for you.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Oh, thank you, Mother Hubbard. I'm very fond of Banbury buns.
Good-by!</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> Good-by, Jack. Tell your mother I'll be over soon.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Bring your dog with you, and we'll have another dance. Good-by.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>Mother Goose and Mother Hubbard at the Tea Table</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> I am pleased to see you, Mother Hubbard. I hear that
your cupboard is no longer bare and empty, and I am very glad you are
able to give your poor dog all the bones a good dog should have. Now for
our tea. Shall I put two or three lumps in your cup?</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> Three, please. I like my tea very sweet. And now tell
me, Mother Goose, what is the reason you sent for me to-day?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Well, I am going to give a party and I wish to ask your
advice.</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> Indeed! Whom do you think of inviting?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> First, the dear Old Woman who lives in the shoe&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> What! and all her children?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> No, only the two eldest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> You know the party is for my
son Jack, too, and we must have the young people as well as their
parents. Old King Cole will come and bring his fiddlers three to play
for the young folks who dance.</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> I hope you won't invite Tom the Piper's Son, or My Son
John as his mother calls him,&mdash;or Humpty-Dumpty. They are not good boys
for your son Jack to play with!</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> I suppose not; but I like them all, and I dislike to
leave out anyone. I don't wish to hurt their feelings.</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> There are little Bo-Peep and Boy Blue, who are good
children, although rather silly; and there are little Miss Muffet and
Nancy Etticoat, both very pretty little girls; and there are Jacky
Horner and Tommy Tucker and the Man-in-the-Moon and Taffey and
Daffey-Down-Dilly and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> I'll have to give a garden party if I invite all those!
I can't leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> any out, and I think I'll have the party out-of-doors.</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> That will be fine! I only hope it will be a pleasant
day. When will you give it?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Two weeks from to-day, the first of May.</p>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> That's May Day and a very good day for a party
out-of-doors. Well I must go home now. Good-by! If I can help you,
please call upon me.</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Thank you, Mother Hubbard! Good-by, and thank you again
for coming over.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV.</span>&mdash;<i>At the Party</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> What a lovely day you have for your party, Mother
Goose! The sun shines so bright and warm, and the flowers are lovely. Is
there anything I can do?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> No, thank you. I'm glad you came early. Have you seen
the tables?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><i>Mother Hubbard.</i> They are lovely! Where did you get such pretty
flowers?</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> From Mistress Mary, quite contrary. You know she has a

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Why, how do you do, A-Dillar-a-Dollar! Are you always in

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Here comes the Old Woman who lives in a shoe, and her
two oldest boys. Dear Mrs. Shoe-woman, I am very glad to see you! How
did you leave all of your children?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shoe-woman.</i> Oh, dear, Mother Goose! I have so many children I
don't know what to do: when they are naughty I give them some broth
without any bread, and whip them all soundly and put them to bed.</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Here are all the children coming to the party! Come,
children, let us have a dance. All stand around the Maypole as I call
your names:</p>

<p>Little Miss Muffet and Boy Blue;</p>

<p>Nancy Etticoat and Jack-be-nimble;</p>

<p>Mary and the little Boy who lives in the Lane.</p>

<p>All take ribbons and stand around the Maypole. Are you all ready?</p>

<p><i>Children.</i> Yes, Mother Goose, we are all ready when the music begins.</p>

<p><i>Mother Goose.</i> Old King Cole, will you have your three fiddlers play
for the dance?</p>

<p><i>King Cole.</i> With pleasure, dear Mother Goose&mdash;and I'll sing:</p>

<h2>LITTLE TWO-EYES</h2>

<p class="fm3">PERSONS IN THE PLAY&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mother</span>, <span class="smcap">Little One-Eye</span>, <span class="smcap">Little Two-Eyes</span>, <span class="smcap">Little
Three-Eyes</span>, <span class="smcap">Little Old Woman</span>, <span class="smcap">Tree</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince</span>, <span class="smcap">Goat</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>Dining Room at Little Two-Eyes' Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Come to dinner, little One-Eye and little Three-Eyes. Here is
some good soup and white bread for you. Little Two-Eyes, you can have
what your sisters do not want.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> Here's a crust for you. That is enough for a girl
with only two eyes.</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> What a shame to have a sister with two eyes! You look
just like other people! Little Three-Eyes and I are very different.</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> Here little Two-Eyes, take this bowl. I don't want
any more and you can have what is left.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Now, children, run away and play. Little Two-Eyes, take the
goat and go out to the hillside. You must stay till it begins to get
dark, and then you may come home. You must work, because you have two
eyes like other people, but my little One-Eye and Three-Eyes may stay at
home and play.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>On the Hillside</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Come, little goat, here is some green grass for you
to eat. I wish that my sisters loved me and that my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> mother was not
ashamed of me. Oh, why do I have two eyes just like all other people? I
am so hungry, Oh, dear! Oh, dear! (<i>Cries.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wood Fairy.</i> My child, why do you cry?</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Because I have only two eyes, and my mother and my
sisters treat me badly. I don't have enough to eat and I am so hungry.
My dress is old, and my sisters have nice dresses and pretty ribbons.
But who are you?</p>

<p><i>Wood Fairy.</i> I am the little Old Woman who lives on this hill. I have
come to help you. Listen, little Two-Eyes! You need never be hungry
again. Say to your little goat:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, rise!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then a table will rise before you with all the food you can eat. When
you have finished eating, you must say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, away!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>and it will disappear before your eyes. Good-by, dear little Two-Eyes. I
must go now, but remember what I have told you.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Why, where has that queer looking little woman gone?
I am so hungry I'll try now if what she said can be true.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, rise!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Goat.</i> Bla-a! Bla-a! Bla-a!</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Oh, look, little goat! what a pretty table! and how
good the food looks. Now we shall have all we want to eat. Here is
something for you, and here are oranges and meat and pudding for me!
Dear little woman! How can I thank her? Now I can eat no more.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, away!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Goat.</i> Bla-a! Bla-a! Bla-a!</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> There, it is gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> Aren't we happy, little goat? But
see, it is time to go home. Come, little goat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>At Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Here, little Two-Eyes, here are the crusts your sisters saved
for you.</p>

<p><i>Two-Eyes.</i> Thank you, mother, but I don't care for any crusts. I'm not
hungry.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Not care for them? You are not hungry? You have always eaten
them before now and asked for more! You didn't eat any supper last
night, either. What does this mean? What did you have to eat to-day?</p>

<p><i>Two-Eyes.</i> I cannot tell you, mother.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> You cannot? Then, little One-Eye, you shall go to the hillside
with little Two-Eyes and find out why she is no longer hungry.</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> I don't want to go! The walk is too long, and I shall
get tired!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><i>Mother.</i> Just this once, my dear! You will not have to go again. But we
must learn the secret.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Come, sister. Come, little goat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV.</span>&mdash;<i>The Hillside</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Now we are almost there. Are you tired, little
One-Eye?</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> Oh! I am so tired, and my feet hurt so I can hardly
walk.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> I have to walk this far every day.</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> Yes, but you have two eyes like other people and you
must expect to work. I cannot go any farther. I'll lie down here and
rest.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> I'll sing you a pretty song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Are you awake, little One-Eye?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you asleep, little One-Eye?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, you are asleep, little One-Eye, and now I can have my dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, rise!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Goat.</i> Bla-a! Bla-a! Bla-a!</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Here is the little table again! Oh, how thankful I am
for the good food. Dear little old woman, you are very good to send me
such nice things to eat. Here is some for you, little goat. Now I have
had enough.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, away!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There, it is gone. Little One-Eye, wake up! It is time to go home.</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> Did I go to sleep?</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Indeed, you did, and now we must hurry home. Come,
little goat!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene V.</span>&mdash;<i>At Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Well, little One-Eye, tell us what you have seen. Why doesn't
little Two-Eyes eat the food we have for her?</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> I don't know, mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> The way was so long and I was
so tired; I fell asleep; and when I woke up it was time to come home.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> It was a hard walk for you, my dear; but we must find out who
is giving little Two-Eyes something to eat. To-morrow you must go,
little Three-Eyes.</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> I'll find out, mother. If anyone dares to give food
to little Two-Eyes, I'll tell you all about it.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Yes, my dear, I know you won't go to sleep. I can trust you to
find out everything.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VI.</span>&mdash;<i>On the Hillside</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Come, sister, we must go on, for it is a long way to
the top of the hill.</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> I'm not going any farther, I'm too tired! I'll rest
a little here.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> All right, little Three-Eyes. I'll sing you a song.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Are you awake, little Three-Eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you asleep, little Two-Eyes?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, you are asleep, and now I'll have my dinner.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, rise!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Goat.</i> Bla-a! Bla-a! Bla-a!</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Here is our dinner again, little goat. See this fresh
lettuce and cabbage and good bread and butter. Here is some honey, too,
and cake. Isn't this a good dinner?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, away!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Goat.</i> Bla-a, bla-a, bla-a!</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Now it is gone. Three-Eyes, wake up! It is time home.</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> How long I have slept! What will my mother say? But
I think I have a surprise for you, little Two-Eyes!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VII.</span>&mdash;<i>At Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Well, little Three-Eyes, did you go to sleep, too?</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i>&mdash;Yes, mother, but only with two eyes. Little
Two-Eyes sang to me,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Are you awake, little Three-Eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you asleep, little Two-Eyes?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so two of my eyes went to sleep, but one stayed awake and watched.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> What did you see? Tell me quickly, dear little Three-Eyes.</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> First she said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Little goat, bleat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little table, rise!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the goat said, "Bla-a, bla-a, bla-a!" Then a table came up out of
the ground. Oh! it was such a pretty little table with a white cloth
over it and all kinds of good things on it. No wonder little Two-Eyes
doesn't eat any of our common food. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> isn't good enough for her! She
has food fit for a queen,&mdash;nuts and cake, and candy, too!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> So that is why little Two-Eyes doesn't eat the crusts we save
for her! Well, I'll see if she is going to have better food, than we
have. Bring me the long sharp knife.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Goes out and soon returns.</i>]</p>

<p>There, now the goat is dead. Little Two-Eyes, perhaps you'll eat the
food we give you now!</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Oh, my poor little goat! What shall I do without it!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Go to bed, and to-morrow morning you shall go to the hillside
alone. And you must stay there all day, too.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>On the Hillside</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Oh, dear! Oh, dear! my poor goat is dead! Now I shall
be hungry and lonely too! Where shall I go, and what can I do?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><i>Little Wood Fairy.</i> Little Two-Eyes, why are you weeping?</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Because my mother has killed my poor goat, and she
has sent me here to stay all alone, and I am so hungry and thirsty
again.</p>

<p><i>Little Wood Fairy.</i> Little Two-Eyes, let me tell you what to do. Ask
your sisters to give you the heart of your goat. Bury it in the ground
before the house door. Watch, and to-morrow a wonderful tree will come
up out of the ground.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Thank you, dear little woman! I'll go home and do as
you have told me.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IX.</span>&mdash;<i>At Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Little One-Eye and little Three-Eyes, please let me
have the heart of my goat!</p>

<p><i>One-Eye.</i> Certainly, if that is all you want.</p>

<p><i>Three-Eyes.</i> Here it is, but I don't see what you want it for!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span><i>Little Two-Eyes</i> (<i>goes to door</i>). Now I'll plant it as the little
woman told me. I wonder what kind of a tree will appear to-morrow? Poor
little goat, I'm so sorry you have gone! Now I must go into the house
and try to sleep.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene X.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Garden</i></h3>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> Mamma, mamma, look here! Come quickly! Isn't this a
wonderful tree!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Why, how strange! This tree was not here yesterday. I wonder
how it came! I never saw such a beautiful tree before!</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> Do you see the golden apples on it? O mamma! may we
have some? Please, mother!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Yes, dear little One-Eye. You are the oldest, climb up into
the tree and pick some golden apples for us.</p>

<p><i>One-Eye.</i> That will be fun. Here I go!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><i>Mother.</i> Why don't you get the apples, little One-Eye?</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> They all get away from me. When I try to pick one it
springs back!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/gray096.jpg" width="375" height="334" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Come down, little One-Eye. Now little Three-Eyes, you can see
better with your three eyes, than your sister with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> her one eye. You may
climb up and get some apples for us.</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> I'll pick a lot of them and throw them down for you
to catch. Why, how funny they act! I almost get one and it always
springs away!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Come down and let me try. I never heard of fruit that would
not be picked. Now children, I'll get some of the lovely apples for you.
There! Why, what is the matter? I can't reach a single apple.</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Let me try; perhaps I can pick some.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> You, with your two eyes! How can you expect to get them if we
can't?</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Please let me try, mother.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Well, I suppose you can try, but I know you can't get them.</p>

<p><i>Two-Eyes.</i> Here they are. Catch them, mother; catch them, little
One-Eye! Oh, mother! I see a young man on horseback<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> coming along the
road. He looks like a prince.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Hurry down, little Two-Eyes! He must not see you,&mdash;a girl with
two eyes! I'm ashamed of you. Hide under this barrel!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The prince rides up.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Good morning, ladies, what a lovely tree you have here! She
who gives me a branch shall have whatever she wishes.</p>

<p><i>Little One-Eye.</i> The tree is ours, Great Prince; but when we try to get
its fruit, it slips away from us.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> It is strange, if the tree belongs to you, that you cannot get
the fruit! But where do these apples come from?</p>

<p><i>Little Three-Eyes.</i> We have another sister, but she has only two eyes
and we are ashamed of her; so we hid her under this barrel, and she has
rolled the apples out to you.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Little Two-Eyes, come out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> Can you get me a branch from this
wonderful tree?</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> Yes, Prince; here is a branch with many golden apples
on it.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> And what is your wish, little Two-Eyes?</p>

<p><i>Little Two-Eyes.</i> O Prince! My mother and my sisters are ashamed of me
and do not treat me well. They do not give me enough to eat and they do
not like to have me near them. Please take me away where I can be happy
and free!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DAYS_OF_THE_WEEK" id="THE_DAYS_OF_THE_WEEK"></a>THE DAYS OF THE WEEK</h2>

<p class="fm3">THE WEEK&mdash;<span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <span class="smcap">Sunday</span></p>

<p><i>Monday.</i> Well, I am glad to be here at last. Certainly my work is very
important. As the first working day of the week, I begin all business;
and I have always heard that if a thing is well begun, it is half done.
People call me Moon-day&mdash;isn't that a pretty name, the day of the moon?
How beautiful the moon is, riding in her silver chariot across the dark
blue sky! I am proud of my name. The moon is constantly changing and I
like change. I like brightness and cleanliness too, and good housewives
wash their clothes on Monday. How white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> and clean they look hanging on
the line! The sun and wind play hide and seek and help to cleanse the
clothes. School begins on Monday and the little children run and laugh
on their way to school. Every one seems happy that another week has
begun.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 177px;">
<img src="images/gray101.jpg" width="177" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i> I am named for Tui, the god of war. In the countries of the
north I am greatly honored by all the people. Soldiers when going to war
call on Tui for help, and they like to begin a battle on Tuesday. Monday
likes to begin work, but I like to make some progress. The children
always know their lessons better on Tuesday, and are happier than on
Monday. The white clothes are sprinkled and rolled, and now the maids
iron the pretty baby dresses and the house linen. They sing and laugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
over their work. The world is all running smoothly on Tuesday, and I
think I like my work the best.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 208px;">
<img src="images/gray102.jpg" width="208" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i> I should be the best of days, for I am named for Woden, or
Odin, the king of the gods. The hardest work of the week is finished
when I come, and there is time for a rest. Perhaps mother will bake a
special cake for dinner. To-day the children take their music lessons,
and the boys go for a lesson in swimming or gymnastic exercise. This is
the day young people choose for their wedding day, and you don't know
how glad I am to be a part of their happiness. I believe I have more
sunshine than the other days, for Woden likes to have clear skies and
health-giving breezes. I would not change with any of my sister days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/gray103.jpg" width="249" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i> I bring the thunder and the lightning, and I cleave the dark
clouds with my rapid flashes. I glory in a storm, for Thor, the god of
thunder, has chosen me for his day, and I bear his name. A life of ease
and quiet has no charms for me. I like the din and crash of war, the
noise and hurry of business. The fury of the heavens, the crash of
falling trees, the roaring of waters,&mdash;what can give greater pleasure?
Business thrives on Thursday. Men rush to and fro, buying and selling,
building great houses, digging in the mines, and sailing the seas. Life
and action are my delight. Hurrah for Thor's day!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/gray104.jpg" width="245" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Friday.</i> After the bustle and work of the week I come to clean and
settle all disturbances. Now dirt and dust must disappear under the
broom and brush.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> How the windows shine and how spotless is the hearth!
Children rake up the leaves and burn them; all rubbish must be cleared
away. Order and neatness I love; and so does Freya, for whom I am named.
She is the goddess of beauty, and there is no beauty where neatness and
order are absent. Some say that I am an unlucky day, but that is a
mistake. See what wonderful things have happened on my day, what great
men have been born on Friday! I am the last school day of the week, and
to-day the children may forget lessons and play outdoors a little
longer. To-day the family gather for a story at the twilight hour, and
all is rest and happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/gray105.jpg" width="185" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Saturday.</i> I am the jolly day of the week. "School is out!" the
children cry, and all day long they sing and call to each other in their
games. To-day I smell the cakes and pies cooking in the range, for
Saturday is baking day. How the little children love to watch mother
stirring the cake and frosting, and how they beg to clean the sweet
stuff out of the bowl. Father comes home earlier to-day, and all go for
a walk in the woods or park. All men need a holiday, for "all work and
no play makes Jack a dull boy." The boys play ball and run and shout in
their joy. The girls have little parties, and cook gives them some fresh
cakes. I am named for Saetere, god of the harvest, and he is always
merry. So I wish all people to be happy on Saturday, the play day of the
week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 133px;">

</div>

<p><i>Sunday.</i> You have all spoken well, my sisters, and each one has some
claim to be the best day of the week. How fine it is that every day
holds some special joy in work or play! But you all know the highest joy
is mine. I am named for the golden sun that gives light to the world. On
Sunday men think of the inner light that makes them love the good and
the true and persuades them to do right. To-day the family is united,
and in the morning with fresh garments and happy faces they seek the
knowledge of a higher life. Around the dinner table they talk happily
together of their work and play, and they plan how they may do better
work during the next week. Love and peace are in all hearts. A desire to
help the weak and poor and sad is in every soul. I am happy and blest to
be Sunday.</p>

<h2>KING ALFRED</h2>

<p class="fm3">PERSONS IN THE PLAY&mdash;<span class="smcap">Queen Judith</span>, <span class="smcap">Ethelbald</span>, <span class="smcap">Ethelbert</span>, <span class="smcap">Ethelred</span>,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, <span class="smcap">Peasants</span>, <span class="smcap">King's Officers</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Castle</i></h3>

<p><i>Ethelbald.</i> Tell us a story, lady mother.</p>

<p><i>Ethelbert.</i> Yes, tell us a story.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><i>Ethelred.</i> I wish it would stop raining, so that we might take our
hawks for a hunt!</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> I have something to show you, my princes. Is not this a
beautiful book?</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> How lovely the red velvet, and see, the clasp is of gold!</p>

<p><i>Ethelred.</i> And there are jewels in the clasp!</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> It is well bound, as so precious a volume should be; but the
binding is the least valuable part of the book. Shall we look within?</p>

<p><i>Ethelbald.</i> Pray show us, lady mother!</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> Observe the forms of mighty warriors, fair ladies, and royal
chiefs of the olden times in bright and glowing colors.</p>

<p><i>Ethelbert.</i> How brave they look! Who are they? Tell us of them, dear
mother.</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> These pictures are beautiful and appeal to the eye, but neither
they nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> the velvet and gold of the binding give the joy which is
greatest.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> What do you mean, dear lady mother?</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> This is a book I greatly enjoy, for it is full of the tales of
the mighty King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. You will like
to hear me read these brave stories when you are tired with your day's
work, or on rainy days when you can neither hunt nor ride. Then you know
not how to amuse yourselves and time is heavy on your hands, since you
can neither read nor play upon the musical instruments that give us so
much pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Ethelred.</i> The book is so lovely. Let me take it, lady mother!</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> I would that the children of my royal husband could read the
book.</p>

<p><i>Ethelbald.</i> Our father does not think much of books and music. He likes
to hunt and fight, and so do I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><i>Ethelred.</i> And I love to hunt, but I love to hear the stories of great
kings and warriors, too.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> To which of us wilt thou give the book, lady mother?</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> I will bestow it on him who shall first learn how to read it.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Will you really, dear mother?</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> Yes, upon the faith of a queen, I will. I will not give it to
one who cannot read it. Books are meant for the learned and not for the
ignorant. The sons of a king should cease to play with toys.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> May I take the book a little while?</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> Yes, you may take the precious volume, Alfred, for I know you
will not injure it, and I hope you will soon learn how to make its
wisdom your own.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Thank you, lady mother. I shall study the book and learn to
read, for I wish to know all about the brave knights of Arthur's court.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Years later, when Alfred is King</i></h3>

<p class="fm3"><span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, <span class="smcap">Oscar the Earl</span>, <span class="smcap">Odulph, the Earl's Son</span></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> All the others have gone back to their homes. In no other way
can ye serve me. Wherefore do ye go about to weep and break my heart?</p>

<p><i>Oscar.</i> We weep, royal Alfred, because thou hast forbidden us to share
thy fortunes; as if we were the swarm of summer flies, who follow only
while the sun shineth.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> My valiant Oscar, and you my faithful Odulph, listen to me. I
do not despair. The time is not ripe now for further war. Our foes the
Danes have conquered us for a time. I trust that the time will come when
we shall drive them from our land. But we must do that which seems best
for the present and seek to be more successful in the future. We must
not sit down and weep; no, this rather shall you do. Go back to your own
people and keep me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> in their memory. When the Dane rules most cruelly,
then rise up and cry aloud in the ears of the people, "Alfred the king
yet liveth!" Then gather the soldiers and I shall come to lead them to
victory.</p>

<p><i>Oscar.</i> Thou shalt be obeyed, my royal lord. I will return to my men
and do as thou hast said. But let my son Odulph stay with thee, if only
as thy servant.</p>

<p><i>Odulph.</i> Well will I serve thee, my royal lord. It is not well for the
king to fare alone.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I am well content to serve myself, or even to be servant to
others, until a happier time shall come. If Odulph desires to serve me,
it shall be by bringing good tidings of your success with my people.
When the time comes that we may again fight for our country, let him
bring me the welcome message. Then we will free our country from the
Danish yoke.</p>

<p><i>Oscar.</i> Farewell, my royal master, since thou wilt have it so.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><i>Odulph.</i> And may the time soon come when I shall bring the message to
thee!</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Farewell, my loyal friends. All will be well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Peasant's Home</i></h3>

<p class="fm3"><span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, <span class="smcap">Peasant Cudred</span>, <span class="smcap">Wife Switha</span></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Save you, good father! May a Saxon stranger, whom the Danish
robbers have made homeless, share a lodging with thy master's cattle for
the night?</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Wilt thou swear to me that thou art not a Dane in disguise?</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I say to thee, my friend, I am no Dane, but a true Saxon.</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Then thou shalt share the calf's crib to-night. Perchance thou
art hungry, too?</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> To say truth, father, I have not broken my fast to-day;
neither have I had aught to drink save from these marshy streams. I
shall be right thankful for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> some food, even a crust of coarsest rye
bread.</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Rye bread, forsooth! Thou talkest of dainties indeed! Thou
wilt get nothing better than flat oaten cakes here.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I have always wished to taste an oaten cake.</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Follow me, then, and thou shalt have thy desire. Switha,
Switha!</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Well, I hear thee!</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Switha, I have brought thee home a guest who will be glad to
partake of our supper.</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> A guest! And thinkest thou I've naught better to do than broil
fish and bake cakes for all the vagabonds who roam the land?</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Patience, good Switha. I have not asked thee to cook for a
vagabond. This is an honest Saxon whom it will be charity to feed and
shelter for the night.</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Let me hold the torch and see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> this Saxon guest. Thou lookest
like a guest of fashion, sorry fellow!</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Cease thy scolding talk, woman! I see by this light that our
guest hath not been used to beg for charity from such as thou. Why be so
hard of heart and by thy rude taunts make bitter the food he must
receive from our hands?</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> I have heard that charity begins at home, and I am sure we are
poor enough.</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Not poor enough to refuse food to the hungry, such as it is.
Here is fish, and here an oaten cake which you wish to taste.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Thanks for your goodness, kind host. Indeed, I am hungry.</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> You eat like a hungry wolf.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> And now I am hungry no longer. I thank you both for a good
supper, and I hope you will never be sorry you have given charity to a
stranger. Now, Cudred, I shall be glad to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> This way, then, to the bed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> straw. Now, tell me truly, art
thou not some mighty earl in disguise?</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I am Alfred, thy king&mdash;I know from thy goodness to me when
thou thoughtest me a beggar that thou art a good man, therefore I
confide in thee. I know thou wilt not betray thy king.</p>

<p><i>Cudred.</i> Not all the gold of Denmark should tempt me to commit so base
a crime, but we must not let Switha know who thou art, my royal master.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I shall be careful. Soon, I hope, my friends will bring me
word that my army awaits me, when I shall again try to set my country
free.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Peasant's Hut</i></h3>

<p class="fm3"><span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, <span class="smcap">Switha</span></p>

<p><i>King Alfred.</i> It rains so hard to-day that I cannot hunt, so will mend
my bow and make some new arrows. May I sit by your fire, good dame
Switha?</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Yes, and as I have made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> good batch of cakes you might watch
them bake.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Gladly will I watch them. Show me what I must do.</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Turn them often before the fire, thus, so that they will not
burn. Now I will go for more wood for the fire.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> How long, I wonder, must I remain in hiding. It is very hard
to wait. If only I knew how my people were faring. Will the time never
come when I can rule over England and unite my people? So many plans
have I for their happiness and progress. Schools we must have. The Bible
must be translated for the people to read. Roads must be built and the
country made safe for all. How long must I sit in Cudred's cottage
mending arrows when my heart wishes to help my suffering people!</p>

<p><i>Switha</i> (<i>running in</i>). I thought I smelled them burning! Oh, thou
lazy, useless fellow! Thou art ready enough to eat the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> cakes, but too
lazy to keep them from burning. No wonder thou hast no home, idle as
thou art.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I pray thee, good dame, forgive me. I was lost in thought of
happier days and forgot my duty. Really I am sorry.</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Ay, ay, that is always the way with thee. That smooth tongue
of thine is better to thee than silver or gold; for it obtains for thee
food, lodging, and friends, and softens all the wrath thy faults
provoke. However, I shall set by all the burnt cakes for thy portion of
the week's bread, I promise thee; and thou shalt have no other till they
are all eaten.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> My good mistress, here comes a pilgrim boy to ask thy charity.
May I bestow one of these cakes on him?</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Thou mayest do what thou wilt with thine own, man! but do not
presume to give away my property to idle fellows like thyself.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> But, mistress, may I not give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> him that which was to have been
my portion for dinner?</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> No, indeed! I have enough to do with feeding one vagrant
without adding all the lazy pilgrims who pass by.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> See, mistress, my amulet! I will give thee this jewel, Switha,
if thou wilt permit me to feed this poor pilgrim.</p>

<p><i>Switha.</i> Very well, then. Give him thy portion while I go and hide the
jewel.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Goes out as Odulph enters.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Welcome, Odulph! Tell me thy tidings. I hunger for good news.</p>

<p><i>Odulph.</i> My tidings, royal Alfred, are these: Hubba, the Dane, the
terror of England, is slain, and his banner of the Raven waves in my
father's hall!</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> What? Is thy father's castle in the possession of the Danes?</p>

<p><i>Odulph.</i> Not so, my royal master; but the banner of the Danes, captured
by your victorious Saxons, hangs in his hall. We were pent up in the
castle by the Danes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> till our provisions failed. When the last loaf was
eaten, and our archers had launched their last arrows, my valiant father
led the garrison in an attack upon the foe.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Brave Oscar! And you defeated them!</p>

<p><i>Odulph.</i> Yes, because of the carelessness of the Danes. They believed
they had us in their power, and they never dreamed we would leave the
castle walls. Few as we were, we fell upon them and slew their chiefs.
The soldiers fled, and left our men victorious. Then my father raised
the cry, "Alfred the king!" All the country is calling, "Alfred the
king!"</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> The time is ripe. I thank you, Odulph. Your father is a noble
man, and I shall know how to show a king's gratitude to you both. Shall
we go?</p>

<p><i>Odulph.</i> Lead on, King Alfred, England is ready. Soon you shall head
your army shouting, "Long live King Alfred!"</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Greenwood.</i></h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Robin Hood and his men making arrows.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> This feather is too short. Give me another, Little John.
This is a better one.</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> Making arrows is not a simple thing, is it, my master?</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Indeed, no; if the feathers be too short, the arrows will
not keep true to their course; and if the feathers be too long, the
arrows will not fly swiftly.</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> If all men knew how to make arrows, their skill in
shooting would seem greater. Look to your arrows, say I, before you
shoot.</p>

<p><i>Will Scarlet.</i> We should thank the gray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> goose for the even growth of
her feathers, which carries our arrows straight to the mark.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> First the strong bow that bends to our hand, then the
straight arrow, tough and trim, and the feathers that wing it to its
mark. But best of all the steady hand and keen eye that direct our
winged shaft. But you have worked well this morning, my men, and now we
may rest awhile. Sing us a song, Will Scarlet, while we lie beneath the
friendly oak.</p>

<p><i>Will Scarlet</i> (<i>sings</i>).</p>

<span class="i1">To bring the deer to bay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Little John.</i> This song is well enough in its way, but for me, I should
much prefer a good dinner. The morning's work has given me a fine
appetite and I long for food.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> It is good to eat, but not before we find some rich
traveler to pay the bill. Ride out, my man, and find us a host. Willing
or unwilling, bid him come.</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> With right good will, my master; and may I soon meet with
him!</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Remember well, no farmer shall you bring. He works for
what he gets and shall live in peace. And the laborer who toils for wife
and child you must not harm. Only those who oppress the poor and weak,
those who are selfish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> and unkind, who play while others weep, these
shall you bring to me.</p>

<p><i>Will Scarlet.</i> But look, my master, what sorrowing knight rides there?
His garments are rich and his horse gayly decked, but his countenance is
sad and he rides slowly, careless of the way.</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> Hail, gentle knight; my master awaits you and fain would
have your company at dinner.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> At dinner,&mdash;in the wood! Who is your master?</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> Robin Hood is he: and here he is to bid you welcome.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Welcome, Sir Knight, thrice welcome art thou, for I have
fasted beyond the dinner hour. Pray you, dismount.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> God save you and all your company!</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> The dinner is served, my master.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Will you join us, Sir Knight? Here are pheasants and swans
and meat of the deer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><i>The Knight.</i> Such a good dinner, with so many brave men, I have not
eaten for many a day. If I come again to this country, I will make thee
as good a dinner. But Heaven knows when that will be!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/gray143.jpg" width="350" height="334" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Thanks for your kind offer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> But in the greenwood our
guests must pay for their food. A yeoman does not pay for a rich knight!</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Sorry am I that you must call me poor. I would that I
could pay you, but in my saddlebags are no more than ten shillings.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Is that indeed the truth, Sir Knight? Look carefully,
Little John; if the knight speaks truly, he shall keep the ten
shillings, but if not&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> Indeed, my master, the knight speaks truly, for this is
all the money I can find.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> How comes it, noble knight, that thou art so poor? Come,
tell me the story. Mayhap I can help thee.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> I am Sir Richard of Lea, and my ancestors have been
knights for a hundred years. A year ago I had plenty of money to spend
as I would. But now I have nothing for my wife and my children, who weep
for my absence from them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><i>Robin Hood.</i> But how did you lose all your money?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Perhaps you will think I lost it in a foolish way. My son,
whom I dearly love, is a manly youth. Well can he shoot and joust fairly
in the field. But once, in a quarrel, he slew a youth, and to save him,
I pledged all my lands. Unless I redeem them by All Saints Day I shall
lose them all.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> What is the sum you are bound to pay?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Four hundred pounds. The day is near and I have nothing.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> But what canst thou do if thou losest thy land? What wilt
thou do?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> I will sail far away over the seas. I cannot remain in
England.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> It is a small sum. Hast thou no friends to help thee in
thy need?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Many friends had I when I had money and lands. Now when I
need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> their help they turn away and know me not.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> By my faith, gentle knight, thou shalt not want for a
friend. Little John, go to the chest and count out four hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Will Scarlet.</i> Shall he not have cloth for a coat, gentle master? He is
thinly clad.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> Well said, Will Scarlet; go, get three measures of every
kind, that he may be warmly and gayly clad.</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> Here is the money, Robin Hood, and good measure.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood.</i> And what will you give, Little John, who are so generous
with my money?</p>

<p><i>Little John.</i> A pair of golden spurs, that he may ride fast to his
castle and redeem his lands.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Many thanks, Little John, and to you, my good friend. Tell
me, Robin Hood, when shall I come to return the money you so kindly lend
me?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span><i>Robin Hood.</i> This day twelvemonth; and a happy year may it be! We will
meet under this trysting tree. Till then, be merry!</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> I shall be with you a year from to-day. Farewell.</p>

<p class="fm3"><span class="smcap">The Abbot</span>, <span class="smcap">The Prior</span></p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> This day a year ago Sir Richard Lea borrowed four hundred
pounds from me. He promised to pay in a year or lose his land. If he
does not return to-day, the land will be mine.</p>

<p><i>The Prior.</i> The day is now far spent. Perhaps he will come yet.</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> I am sure I hope he will not. I trust he has left England.</p>

<p><i>The Prior.</i> The land is worth much more than four hundred pounds. It
were a pity if he did not redeem it.</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> Thou art ever crossing me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> Speak no more about it! Where

justice on that Knight. Where is he?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><i>The Abbot.</i> The Knight has failed to come with the money and this is

keep his promise and his lands are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Knight</i> (<i>entering and kneeling before the Abbot</i>). Rejoice with
me, Sir Abbot. I am come to keep my day.</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> What dost thou say? Hast brought the money?</p>

<p><i>The Knight</i> (<i>to try the Abbot</i>). Not a penny, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> What dost thou here without the money?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> To ask your kindness and patience, Sir Abbot, for a longer
time.</p>

<p><i>Lord Justice.</i> The day has come. Thou losest thy land, Sir Knight,
since thou canst not pay.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Good Lord Justice, help me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> against my foes! I will surely
pay, but must have more time.</p>

<p><i>Lord Justice.</i> I am sorry for thee, Sir Richard, but the law is plain.
Either pay your debt or lose your land.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Sir Abbot, I pray thee, have pity.</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> Get the land when thou canst, thou gettest no pity from me.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> By my faith, then, if I get not my land again, thou shalt
pay dearly for it.</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> Get thee gone, false knight! Darest thou threaten me?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> False knight I am not, for I have fought well for my king.</p>

<p><i>Lord Justice.</i> Sir Abbot, the day is not yet gone. What wilt thou give
the knight to hold his peace?</p>

<p><i>The Abbot.</i> A hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Lord Justice.</i> Make it two hundred.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> No, nor nine hundred. Ye shall not have my land! Here, Sir
Abbot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> are the four hundred pounds. Had you been less covetous, I would
have given interest. Now, get you gone, all of you; and learn to deal
more justly and kindly with those in need. [<i>They go out.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Lady Lea</i> (<i>entering</i>). Oh, my dear husband! how glad I am to hear your
voice again.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Happy am I to see you and to be at home again. I must tell
you how kind Robin Hood has been to me.</p>

<p><i>Lady Lea.</i> Robin Hood your friend? Is he not the outlaw of the forest?</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> Yes; but he is kind to all who are unhappy or oppressed.
He saved me from leaving England and gave me money to redeem my land.</p>

<p><i>Lady Lea.</i> How I long to thank him for his goodness to you.</p>

<p><i>The Knight.</i> In a year we will go to him and repay the four hundred
pounds.</p>

<p><i>Lady Lea.</i> I shall be glad to see him and his merry men, and try to
thank them all.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_TELL" id="WILLIAM_TELL"></a>WILLIAM TELL</h2>

<h3>A STORY OF SWITZERLAND. <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1307</h3>

<p class="fm3">PERSONS IN THE PLAY&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Tell</span>; <span class="smcap">Lewis, his son</span>; <span class="smcap">Albert, his son</span>;
<span class="smcap">Annette, his wife</span>; <span class="smcap">Lalotte, his niece</span>, <span class="smcap">Gessler</span>, <span class="smcap">Soldiers</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>At Tell's Home</i></h3>

<p><i>Albert.</i> Lewis, doesn't the quail smell good?</p>

<p><i>Lewis.</i> Yes, I wish I could have some of it!</p>

<p><i>Lalotte.</i> Hush! the quail is for your father.</p>

<p><i>Albert.</i> I know that, Lalotte; but I am hungry, and I like quail.</p>

<p><i>Lalotte.</i> Your father will be cold and hungry, for he has been on a
long journey.</p>

<p><i>Albert.</i> But perhaps he will not come. Mother, mother! may we have the
quail if father is late? It is done now, and it will not be good if it
is cooked any more.</p>

<p><i>Lalotte.</i> Hush, you greedy boy! If I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> were your mother, I would send
you to bed for thinking of such a thing.</p>

<p><i>Albert.</i> You are not the mistress. You are not the mistress, and I
shall not go to bed because you say so!</p>

<p><i>William Tell</i> (<i>at door</i>). But you shall go to bed, young man, if your
Cousin Lalotte tells you to do so. Take them to bed, Lalotte.</p>

<p><i>Albert.</i> Oh, father! We were only joking.</p>

<p><i>Lewis.</i> Please, father, don't send us to bed.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> I must, my boy, because it is late, and I have news for
your mother. Good night, my sons.</p>

<p><i>Boys.</i> Good night, dear father.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>They go out with Lalotte.</i>]</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Thy father's news is not for young ears.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> There is a sadness in thy voice, and trouble in thy face!
Tell me what has happened to thee! Wilt thou not trust me?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span><i>William Tell.</i> Yes, my Annette! Thou hast ever been a good wife and
faithful friend. Why should I conceal my deeds from thee?</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> What hast thou done, my husband?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Perhaps thou wilt blame me.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> Nay, for thou art a good man, and whatever thou doest is
right in my eyes.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Thou knowest how our foreign rulers oppress the good
people of Switzerland?</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> I do, but why should we poor peasants worry over the affairs
of the nobles?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> But they are our troubles, too. So to-night I have met
with three and thirty men, brave and loyal hearts, who have sworn to
resist our oppressors and free our land from tyranny.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> But how can three-and-thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> men think to conquer the armies
of foreign tyrants?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Sometimes great events are brought about by small means.
All the people in their hearts hate the false ruler of our poor country,
and many of these will willingly die for her sake.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> Thou art brave, my husband, but what can so few do?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Think of it! The father of one of our band has just been
put to a cruel death. No man knows where the tyrant will strike next.
Perhaps Gessler will pick me out for the next victim.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> Thee! What charge could he bring against thee?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> He could say that I am the friend of my country, which
in the tyrant Gessler's mind is a crime.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> But Gessler will never hear of us, humble peasants. He is too
far above us to care what we think.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Not so, my dear wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> Gessler will not permit us to
hold our thoughts in secret. He has a plan to discover our inmost
thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> What plan can he make to read our minds?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> A clever plan to tell a freeman from a slave. In
Altdorf, our capital city, he has set up a pole. Upon the top of this
pole he has put the cap of the Austrian king and has ordered every man
to take off his hat as he passes by, to show that he yields to the
Austrian rule. Is not this a brave plan? He who obeys the tyrant is a
slave. Wouldst thou have thy husband doff his cap to his country's
tyrant?</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> Never! I should despise thee, couldst thou do it!</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> That is my own brave wife! Thou speakest as a free
woman, the mother of free children, should speak. And our children shall
be free! When I go to Altdorf I shall refuse to obey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> the order of
Gessler and all Switzerland shall know that William Tell will not bow to
a foreign tyrant.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> But why go to Altdorf, my husband? Thou knowest the power of
Gessler and his cruelty!</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Wouldst have me a coward? No, dear wife. When my
business calls me to Altdorf I shall go and in all ways act as a free
man, loyal to my country and afraid of no one.</p>

<p><i>Annette.</i> Thou art a brave man, my husband, and I honor thee.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Altdorf: The Market place</i></h3>

<p class="fm3"><span class="smcap">William Tell</span>, <span class="smcap">Albert</span>, <span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>, <span class="smcap">Gessler</span></p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Come, my son, I have sold the chamois skins, and now I
must buy the things your mother wished me to get for her.</p>

<p><i>Albert.</i> And, father, please buy some toys for little Lewis.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> You are a good boy, Al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>bert, to remember your little
brother. We will go to the shop across the square and look there for
toys.</p>

<p><i>Soldier.</i> Halt, man! Salute yonder cap!</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Why should I salute a cap of cloth?</p>

<p><i>Soldier.</i> It is the cap of our emperor. If you do not honor the cap,
you are a traitor.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> I am no traitor, and yet I will not bow down to an empty
cap. I am a true Swiss and love my country.</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> Ha, ha! Then we have a traitor here who will not yield to our
emperor! Arrest him, my men; and we will teach him his manners. Who is
this man?</p>

<p><i>Soldier.</i> His name is William Tell, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> Insolent traitor! Bind him well.</p>

<p><i>Albert.</i> Oh, father, I am afraid. Do not let the soldiers take me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span><i>William Tell.</i> Be calm, my son. No harm will come to thee.</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> Indeed, and is this your son? Has he come to mock the cap of
our royal master, too? Seize the boy and bind him to yonder tree.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> What will you do with the boy? Does a captain war with a
child?</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> We shall see. I hear you are a famous shot, William Tell, and
handle well the bow and arrow. We shall soon know your skill. Have you a
good arrow in your quiver? Perhaps you can shoot an apple from the head
of your child.</p>

<p><i>Soldier.</i> Where shall I bind the boy, my captain?</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> To yonder tree. If his father shoots the apple from his
child's head, he shall go free. If he fails he must die. Are you ready?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Rather would I die than risk killing my eldest son. Let
him go, and take my life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span><i>Gessler.</i> That I shall not do. You must both die unless you save your
lives as I have said. Will you try the shot or are you afraid?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;">
<img src="images/gray160.jpg" width="451" height="510" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Bind the boy's eyes, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> beg. He might move if he saw the
arrow coming, and my skill would be in vain.</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> I am willing, for well I know you cannot cleave the apple at
that distance.</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Tyrant! I cannot fail now, when my son's life depends
upon me. Stand perfectly still, my brave boy, and father will not hurt
you. Now I pray for strength&mdash;my trusty arrow must not fail me! There!
[<i>He shoots.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Soldier.</i> See, my captain! The apple is split! That was a fine shot!</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> Yes, it was a good shot, and I did not believe anyone could
make it. I suppose I must set you free. But why have you that other
arrow in your hand?</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> To shoot you with it had I killed my darling boy.</p>

<p><i>Gessler.</i> Seize him, my men!</p>

<p><i>William Tell.</i> Never! Come, Albert! This arrow for him who stops me!</p>

<p><i>Soldiers.</i> He has escaped!</p>

<h2><a name="TIME_AND_THE_SEASONS" id="TIME_AND_THE_SEASONS"></a>TIME AND THE SEASONS</h2>


<p><i>Father Time.</i> I must call my children together and give them orders for
the New Year. Open the door, my servants, and let the Seasons appear.</p>

<p><i>Spring</i> (<i>entering</i>). Here I am, Father Time. What are your commands
for your youngest daughter?</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> Welcome, my dainty Spring! It is your duty to call the
gentle rains to fall upon the thirsting ground. Yours is the pleasant
task to paint the blades of young grass a delicate green. You call the
birds back from the south and rouse all nature from her winter sleep.
The winds blow freshly over the earth; the clouds move here and there,
bringing the rain; and the bulbs, hidden under the soil, slowly push
their leaves into the sunlight. What flowers will you bring to deck
the earth?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/gray163.jpg" width="364" height="550" alt="Time and the Seasons" title="" />
<span class="caption">Time and the Seasons</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Spring.</i> O Father Time! Look here upon my pretty flowers! Here is the
snowdrop, so white and brave. It pushes its head up through the snow,
which is no whiter than its own petals. And here I have a bunch of
crocuses, blue, yellow, white, and of many colors. Aren't they pretty
amid the grass? Then the gorgeous tulips, holding their heads so high,
making the earth brilliant with their gay, bright colors. I think the
golden daffodils and sweet narcissus are my favorite flowers, though I
am very fond of what the children call spring beauty.</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> I see, my daughter, that you love all your flower
children, and that is right. All are beautiful, each in its own way. And
now tell me what joys do you bring to the little children of the earth?</p>

<p><i>Spring.</i> All the children love me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> They hunt for the first flowers,
they welcome the first birds returning from the south, and they prepare
the garden for the seeds of flowers and vegetables. The boys play
marbles everywhere, and run and laugh, filling their lungs with my
life-giving air. The organ grinder plays for the children and they dance
on the sidewalks, singing and calling out in delight. The trees put
forth their tender leaves. The sun fills the air with golden warmth, and
the world seems full of promise.</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> Well done, my daughter. And now, my daughter Summer, tell
me your plans for the year.</p>

<p><i>Summer.</i> Dear father, I delay my coming until Spring has prepared the
way. The air must be soft and warm to please me, and the earth must be
prepared by the rains and the warm rays of the sun. The colors of my
flowers are deeper and richer than those of sister Spring. I bring the
lilies, the peonies, and the poppies. Best of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> all, the glowing roses
open at my call, and fill the air with perfume.</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> And the children, my fair daughter, what do you bring to
them?</p>

<p><i>Summer.</i> The dear children! I think they all like my sunny days and the
long time for play. For July and August in many countries are given to
the school children for their play time. Then they go to the seashore
and play in the water and the sand; or to the country, where the green
grass, the farmyard animals, and all the country games delight them.</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> Children are so fond of play and the long summer days
out-of-doors that I wonder what they think of you, my older daughter,
Autumn?</p>

<p><i>Autumn.</i> Children do like to play and I am glad they get so well and
strong with the vacation my sister, Summer, gives them. Yet all children
like to learn, too. We must not forget that. What joy it is to read the
beautiful stories that great men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> and women have written for them. What
delight they have in learning to write, to sing, to draw, and to make
pretty objects of paper, clay, and wood.</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> Yes, that is true, but have you no pleasures out-of-doors
for them?</p>

<p><i>Autumn.</i> Some people say my days are the most pleasant of the year. The
gardens have many beautiful flowers, and the fruits are ripening in the
orchards and vineyards. The apples hang red on the boughs, and children
like to pick them and eat them, too! I have the harvest moon, the time
when the farmers bring home the crops ripened by August suns, and the
earth seems to gather the results of the year's work, the riches of
field, orchard, and meadow. The squirrels gather their hoard of nuts and
hide them away for their winter's food. Gay voices of nutting parties
are heard in the woods, and all the air is filled with songs of praise
and thanksgiving for the bounty of the year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><i>Father Time.</i> Your work is surely one of worth and I rejoice with you,
my daughter, in your happiness. You are a true friend of men, showing
them that honest effort and its work will always bring proper reward.
Now, my merry laughing child, what have you to tell us?</p>

<p><i>Winter.</i> Some people think I am your oldest daughter, Father Time, but
they forget that two of my months are always in the New Year. Although
my hair and garments are white, the cold is only outside; my heart is
warm. Have I not jolly St. Nicholas who never grows old? I cover the
earth with my warmest blanket of softest snow, softer and whiter than
ermine, and all the tender flowers sleep cozily and warm until sweet
Spring awakes them. The children get out their sleds and skates, and the
merry sleigh bells ring. What fun it is to build the snow man, and even
if the hands get cold, the eyes shine brighter than in warm days and the
cheeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> are rosy as the reddest flower. "Hurrah for Winter!" shout the
boys. The merriest holidays I have when all hearts are gay and filled
with loving care for others. I would not change, dear Father Time, with
any of my sisters. I say good-by to the passing year and welcome the new
year. If the old year has had troubles and sorrows, all the people turn
with hope to the new, and call to one another the wish, "A Happy New
Year to all!"</p>

<p><i>Father Time.</i> I am glad you are contented with the work you have to do.
And now, my daughters, I must send you out upon your travels all over
the world. May your coming bring peace; joy, and prosperity to all
mankind!</p>

<span class="smcap">The Fox</span>, <span class="smcap">Children</span>, <span class="smcap">Men</span>, <span class="smcap">The Farmer</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Home of Little Old Woman</i></h3>

<p><i>Little Old Woman.</i> Now all my housework is done I think I will make
some gingerbread. There is nothing quite so good for lunch as warm
gingerbread and a glass of milk, or a cup of hot tea. I can make pretty
good gingerbread, too, all of my friends say. Here is the flour and
butter and molasses and milk. Now it is all ready to put into the pan.
But I made too much this time. What shall I do with it? Nothing must be
wasted in a good cook's kitchen. Oh, I know! I'll make a cunning
gingerbread man for the little boy who lives next door.</p>

<p>Where is my knife? Now roll the dough very thin, cut out the round
little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> head, then the neck, now the two arms, now the little fat body,
and last the legs with high heels on the shoes. Well, this certainly is
a fine little gingerbread man. I think I'll make a little hat with a
wide brim. Now I'll put two currants for his eyes, two for his nose,
three for his cute little mouth, and six for the buttons on his coat.</p>

<p>Then I'll sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over him and put him in the oven
to bake.</p>

<p>Let me look at the clock. It is half past eleven. At twelve the
gingerbread man will be baked, ready for the little boy when he comes
home from school.</p>

<p>Well, I've washed the dishes, and set the table for my lunch, and it is
now just twelve o'clock. I'll open the oven door and see if my
gingerbread man is ready.</p>

<p>Oh! what was that! Why, it is the gingerbread man!</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> Yes, it is the ginger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>bread man, and now I'll go and
see the world.</p>

<p><i>Little Old Woman.</i> Go! you mustn't go! You belong to me.</p>

ask them to catch him. Help! help me catch the gingerbread man!</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Yes, ma'am. Where is he? Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> there he is, the little rascal!

<p><i>Little Old Woman.</i> Oh, I know the men can't run as fast as he can, and
they will never catch my gingerbread man! Here are the children coming
from school. I'll call them. Children, children!</p>

<p><i>Children.</i> Yes, little old woman, here we are. What did you call us
for?</p>

<p><i>Little Old Woman.</i> Oh, my dear children, see the gingerbread man I made
for the little boy next door! There he goes running as fast as he can,
and I can't catch him!</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> And the men are running after him, and they can't catch him
either. Just watch me, little woman, I'll catch him for you.</p>

he is near some farmers. I'll call on them to help me. Farmer, farmer,
will you please help me catch the gingerbread man? There he goes over
your wheat field.</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man</i> (<i>in the wood</i>). Ah, ha! and they didn't catch me! and
now I am free to play in the wood. What a pleasant place!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> Well, what sort of a funny little man is this?</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, ha! ah, ha! catch me, if you can!<br /></span>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> Can't I? Well, I <i>have</i> caught you; and now let me see if you
are good to eat. First, I'll try one of your arms. That tastes good!</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> I'm going!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> And now the other arm!</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> I'm going!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> Now for the leg.</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> I'm going!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> Really, Mr. Gingerbread Man, I think you are very good eating
for a hungry fox. Now I'll taste the other leg.</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> I'm going!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> Now for your round little body.</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> I'm going!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> There is not very much left. Just your head for the last
mouthful.</p>

<p><i>Gingerbread Man.</i> I'm gone!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox.</i> Yes, you're gone; and a very nice meal, Mr. Gingerbread Man.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GOOD_FAIRY" id="THE_GOOD_FAIRY"></a>THE GOOD FAIRY</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Wood</i></h3>

<p><i>The Good Fairy.</i> At last I am in this wood where I must save the Lady
Alice from danger. How dark it seems here after the bright light of my
skyey home. Surely I shall be glad to return to the courts of fairyland.
Yet it is pleasant to be of service to the young and innocent, to those
who are good and true. Some there are on earth who do not love the
truth, who do not do the things that are honest and kind, and they must
be punished. Kind and gentle deeds must be rewarded with our help.</p>

<p>Here in this dark grove dwells Comus, an evil spirit, who loves not the
good. Here he finds the unlucky traveler and takes him to his court.
There he offers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> him food and a pleasant drink. But in the glass is a
potion which drives memory from the mind and makes one forget home and
friends. Then the unhappy traveler loses his human head and must have
the head of some animal or bird. Comus enjoys seeing his victims act
like wild and foolish animals or the forest.</p>

<p>In this dangerous wood the Lady Alice and her brothers are wandering,
and my duty it is to protect them from the evil Comus. Hark! I think I
hear the noisy band. Here will I hide and listen.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Comus and his crew enter; men and women with animal heads.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Now the sun has gone from the western heavens and the star of
night shines over us. This is the hour we love the best. All the
serious, wise old people who love the day and its work are weary now and
have gone to bed. We who love fun and a merry dance, we wake when the
sky is flecked with golden stars. Now the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> moon calls the fairies from
brook and fountain to play their merry games and sing. These are the
joys of night in our dark and secret grove. Come, make a merry ring and
dance. No care have we nor fear. We will dance and sing until the first
ray of light is seen in the east.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>They dance until Comus speaks.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Break off! break off! I hear a footstep not our own approaching
this place. Run to your places lest you frighten the traveler whoever it
may be.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>They disappear.</i>]</p>

<p>I believe some maiden approaches. I will weave my spells and appear to
her in the dress of a shepherd and she will not be afraid. Here she
comes. I will step aside and learn how she happens to be alone in my
grove.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Comus hides.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice</i> (<i>entering</i>). I thought I heard the sound of noisy
merrymaking,&mdash;with music as if many were dancing. Here was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> the sound,
but here I see no one. Alas! I should be sorry to meet rude youths, but
where can I go, what can I do, left alone in this dark and gloomy wood?
O my brothers, where are you? When they saw me wearied, unable to go
farther, they left to find me nourishment and shelter, promising soon to
return. Truly they must be lost in this vast forest. O dark night, why
have you stolen the way from them and left me alone and helpless?
Helpless? No, not helpless, for the good mind has helpers ever present
in pure-eyed Faith and white-handed Hope. I will pray to God, who will
send me a guardian to guide me to my home. What is that light I see? My
brothers seek me and I will sing to them. Perhaps they are not far away
and will hear my voice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Within thy airy shell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That likest thy Narcissus are?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O if thou have<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tell me but where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Comus</i> (<i>to himself</i>). What sweet song is this? Can any mortal sing
with such charm and beauty? Such sacred and home-felt delight I never
heard till now. I'll speak to her, and she shall be my queen.</p>

<p><i>Comus</i> (<i>dressed as a shepherd</i>). Hail, fair goddess! for you must be
more than mortal, to sing such sweet and wondrous strain.</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Nay, gentle shepherd. I sang not as loving my own voice,
and praise is lost that falls on unattending ears. Stern necessity
compelled my song.</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> How comes it, Lady, that you are thus alone?</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> My brothers left me upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> grassy turf. Darkness came
upon the grove, and I fear they are lost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/gray183.jpg" width="475" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Were they men full grown or still young?</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Young and fair my brothers are.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span><i>Comus.</i> Two such I saw, so lovely in their youthful grace I thought I
looked upon some fairy scene. If these are the lads you seek, we can
easily find them.</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Gentle villager, quickly tell me the shortest way to them!</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Due west it lies.</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> To find it out, good shepherd, would be too difficult in
this darkness to a stranger.</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> I know every step, fair lady, for I live close by and daily
tread the path in caring for my sheep. Gladly will I conduct you and
find your brothers if they are still in this grove. Till daybreak you
can rest in a cottage near by, where you will be safe until you wish to
travel on.</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Kind shepherd, I take your word, and gladly go to the
shelter you mention. Kindness is often found in lowly homes. Lead on,
and I will follow.</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> This way, fair lady!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Another Place in the Forest</i></h3>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> How our steps are stayed by the darkness of the night
and of the forest. Would that the moon and stars would pierce the
clouds! If only we could see some faint glimmer of a candle in some
lowly hut that would guide us on our way.</p>

<p><i>Second Brother.</i> Or hear the folded flocks, or sound of village flute
or song, or if the cock would crow the watches of the night! Where can
our dear sister be now? Does she wander in the deep grove, or against
the rugged bark of some broad elm lean her head in fear? Perhaps even
while we speak she is the prey of some savage beast!</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Cease, brother, to dream of evils that may not be. No
good can come from false alarms. I do not believe my good sister has
lost herself in fear. Her faith will keep her calm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span><i>Second Brother.</i> I do not fear the darkness and the fact that she is
alone. But I do fear some harm may come to her from rude wanderers in
the wood.</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Yet I believe she is so good and true that evil has no
power to harm her. All powers of good surround her and drive evil away.
But list! Some faint call sounds on my ear.</p>

<p><i>Second Brother.</i> Yes, I hear it now. What should it be?</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Either some one lost in this wood, like ourselves, or
else some roving woodman, or perhaps some robber calling to his fellows!</p>

<p><i>Second Brother.</i> God save my sister!</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Who comes here? Speak! Advance no further!</p>

<p><i>Spirit</i> (<i>as a shepherd</i>). What voice is that? Speak once again.</p>

<p><i>Second Brother.</i> O brother! 'tis my father's shepherd, sure.</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Are you Thyrsis? How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> could you find this dark,
secluded spot? Why did you come?</p>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> To find out you. But where is your lovely sister? Why is she
not with you?</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Without our fault we lost her as we came.</p>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> Alas, then my fears are true!</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> What fears, good Thyrsis?</p>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> I have long known that this wood was held in the power of an
evil spirit, and this evening as I sat me down upon a bank I heard most
lovely strains as if an angel sang. Listening, I knew it was your
sister's voice. I hastened to her and heard her tell Comus of you whom
she had lost. To you I came that we may save her from the evil spirit of
the wood.</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Let us hasten to attack him with our swords.</p>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> Alas! Your bravery I praise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> but it is vain. The evil charm
of Comus can be broken only by a wondrous plant. See, I have it here.
With this will we overcome his fairy spells.</p>

<p><i>Elder Brother.</i> Thyrsis, lead on! And some good angel bear a shield
before us!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>The Palace of Comus</i></h3>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Drink, Lady, of the wine. You are faint and weary, and this
will refresh you. Do not refuse!</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Never will I drink the potion in that glass. You may
control the body, but my free mind you can never bind.</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Why are you angry, Lady? Here is a place filled with all
delight.</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Is this the cottage you told me of, the place of safety
where I could rest. None but good men can offer good things. I will
never drink what you offer. What monsters are these? I pray Heaven guard
me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/gray189.jpg" width="496" height="525" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Dear Lady, stay with me and be my queen. Here may you reign
over all my kingdom. See what royal robes are mine, what jewels, what
costly tables and shining gold and silver. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> sorrow shall you know,
but only joy and pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Lady Alice.</i> Cease your words. You cannot move the mind guided by
honesty and truth. You cannot frighten me, for well I know goodness is
stronger than evil, truth is more powerful than falsehood. The pure
heart cannot be harmed.</p>

<p><i>Comus.</i> Cease, cease! all this is foolishness. Be wise and taste. All
trouble will be forgotten. Come, I insist!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The brothers rush in and drive Comus and his crew away. But Lady Alice
is entranced and cannot move.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> Have you let him escape? You should have seized his wand.
Without that he has no power, but now we must have help to release your
sister from his wicked power. The goddess of our river Severn, the
lovely Sabrina, has power over all the enchantments of Comus. Her will I
call.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sabrina fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen, where thou art sitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddess of the silver lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen and save.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Come from your home in the coral caves of the sea and help this lovely
maiden in distress.</p>

<p><i>Sabrina</i> (<i>entering</i>).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From off the waters fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I set my printless feet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gentle swain, at thy request<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am here!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> Dear goddess, we implore your powerful aid to undo the charm
wrought by the enchanter on this maiden.</p>

<p><i>Sabrina.</i> 'Tis my greatest joy to help the pure and good. Gentle Lady,
look on me. Thrice upon thy finger tips, thrice upon thy lips, I
sprinkle drops from my pure fountain. Then I touch this marble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> seat and
break the spell. All is well. Farewell.</p>

<p><i>Spirit.</i> Fair Sabrina, for this aid I pray that all the pretty rills
will never cease to flow into your broad river. May your banks ever be
fair with groves and meadows sweet, while all men shall praise you for
your gentle deeds. Farewell. Now, Lady, let us hasten from this grove.
Your parents await their dear children, and we must hasten ere they
become alarmed over your delay. Thanks to your pure heart and the aid of
the fair Sabrina, you have come safely through the enchanter's wood.</p>
